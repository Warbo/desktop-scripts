Subject: Check for and start ssh-agent in tunnel.sh
Message-Id: <c0ee9ff7b08c67e4-0-artemis@nixos>

The tunnel.sh script will ask for a passphrase for our key. To prevent
it asking again after a network interruption, we should be running
ssh-agent.

The script currently supports *using* ssh-agent if it's already running,
but doesn't actually check if it's running or start it. It should.
